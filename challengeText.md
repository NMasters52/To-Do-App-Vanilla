Here's a daily challenge for starter-level DOM manipulation in JavaScript:

Challenge: Build a Simple To-Do List
Objective: Create a basic to-do list where users can:

Add a new task
Delete a task
Mark a task as complete
Instructions:

HTML Structure:

Create an input field for users to type a new task.
Add a button to submit the task.
Create an empty list (e.g., <ul>) to display tasks.
JavaScript Functionality:

When the user submits a new task (by clicking the button), add it as a list item (<li>) to the task list.
Each list item should have:
A "Complete" button that marks the task as done (crosses it out).
A "Delete" button that removes the task from the list.
Style the Completed Task:

When a task is marked as complete, apply a CSS class that adds a strikethrough to the text.
Optional Bonus:

Store the tasks in local storage so the list persists even if the page is refreshed.
Example Steps:
User types "Buy groceries" in the input.
User clicks "Add Task."
"Buy groceries" is added to the task list with "Complete" and "Delete" buttons next to it.
Clicking "Complete" crosses out the task.
Clicking "Delete" removes the task from the list.
This challenge will help you practice basic DOM manipulation with event listeners, dynamically creating and removing elements, and applying styles.
